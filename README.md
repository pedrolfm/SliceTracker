### Overview

SliceTracker is a [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) extension designed to support the workflow of the in-bore MRI-guided targeted prostate biopsy (MRgBx) (see references below for [clinical context](http://ncigt.org/prostate-biopsy)). SliceTracker was developed and tested to support transperineal MRgBx procedure in the [Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO)](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/amigo/default.aspx) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston. Its applicability to other types of procedures has not been evaluated.

Capabilities of SliceTracker include:
* automatic processing of the patient DICOM images
* planning of the procedure (biopsy target localization)
* calibration of the intra-procedural image frame of reference with the transperineal biopsy template
* automated segmentation of the prostate gland
* deformable intensity-based registration to support
 * re-identification of the pre-procedurally defined targets in the intra-procedural images
 * automated, continuous tracking of the biopsy targets during the course of the procedure
* structured collection of the relevant data during the course of the procedure (images, results of segmentation and registration, target tracking)
* visualization of the intra-procedural images and support of specialized hanging protocols to facilitate needle tracking, biopsy template and calibration device visualization, assessment of the image registration results, etc.

This is the main publication describing SliceTracker:

Herz, C., MacNeil, K., Behringer, P. A., Tokuda, J., Mehrtash, A., Mousavi, P., Kikinis, R., Fennessy, F. M., Tempany, C. M., Tuncali, K. & Fedorov, A. Open Source Platform for Transperineal In-bore MRI-guided Targeted Prostate Biopsy. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 1–1 (2019). DOI: [10.1109/TBME.2019.2918731](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8721095) PMID: [31135342](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135342) 

Development of SliceTracker is supported in part by the following NIH grants: 

* P41 EB015898 National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), http://ncigt.org
* U24 CA180918 Quantitative Image Informatics for Cancer Research (QIICR), http://qiicr.org
* R01 CA111288 Enabling Technologies for MRI-guided prostate interventions

Several components of SliceTracker were adopted from other open source projects
as follows:
* Needle guidance core functionality was adopted from
  https://github.com/ProstateBRP/NeedleGuideTemplate, courtesy Junichi
  Tokuda @tokjun
* [Z-frame
  calibration](https://github.com/SlicerProstate/SliceTracker/commits/master/ZFrameCalibration)
  was adopted from the [ProstateNav module of 3D Slicer version
  3](https://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Modules:ProstateNav-Documentation-3.6) (see source
  code [here](https://github.com/SlicerProstate/ProstateNav), no revision
  history); although we
  do not have the precise record of contribution to that functionality in the
  ProstateNav module, we believe main contributors were Junichi Tokuda and
  Simon Di Maio (while at BWH, now at [Intuitive
  Surgical](http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/))
